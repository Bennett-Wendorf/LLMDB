# Problem Statement
Information and access to it are an increasingly import part of the modern world. Products and systems do exist to help users find this information as easily as possible, but sometimes users require niche combinations of data that developers did not anticipate. To that end, the goal of this project is to develop a system by which users may ask questions in natural language (English), and also receive an answer in natural language, based on data contained within the specified database.

# Existing Research and Products
<!-- TODO: include brief intro for this section -->

## LLMs
<!-- TODO: This can be info about tuned models (SQLCoder/StarCoder from Defog) and possibly brief intro about general models like GPT-->

## Cohesive Systems
<!-- TODO: Be sure to touch on what LangChain's existing sql_database agent does -->
<!-- TODO: Research other similar systems -->

## Evaluation
<!-- TODO: [defog-ai/sql-eval](https://github.com/defog-ai/sql-eval) -->
<!-- TODO: Look into [salesforce/WikiSQL](https://github.com/salesforce/WikiSQL) -->

# Current Project
<!-- TODO: Include brief intro for this section -->
The current project aims to evaluate the performance of existing techniques in the text-to-SQL category of language models, primarily looking at Langchain's existing sql_database agent, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models. The goal is to determine if these models are capable of answering questions about a database, and if so, how well they perform. Presuming this basic system would not be sufficient for a production use case of text-to-SQL models, the project also aims to identify areas of improvement for the system, and propose possible solutions to these problems as well as implement some of the solutions, time permitting.

## Data
<!-- TODO: Quick writeup on the Chinook database (where to find it, what it contains, etc.) -->
This project uses the famous Chinook database for testing and evaluation. You can find scripts for recreating this database in a variety of SQL implementations in [this Github repository](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database).

As a general overview, the Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music store. It contains information about artists, albums, tracks, invoices, customers, and employees.

## System Overview
<!-- TODO: Write about Divinci, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 (once I get to it) -->
<!-- TODO: Add info about langchain sql agent -->
<!-- TODO: For Langchain, try to discuss what the sql agent already does -->

## Evaluation
<!-- TODO: Add intro about concept behind this -->

### Evaluator LLM
<!-- TODO: Talk about differences in performance -->
<!-- TODO: Possibly include a table here -->
<!-- TODO: Note that accuracy is relatively low, but enough for comparison -->
<!-- TODO: Could improve accuracy with a bit of prompt engineering on the evaluator -->

### Questions
<!-- TODO: Add a complete table of the 32 questions asked -->
To evaluate the models and systems, 32 questions were proposed and human-labeled with difficulty rankings and answers. Four categories of complexity were evaluated: basic (likely no join statements required), simple (likely only one or two simple joins), complex (complex joins and/or sub-queries), and invalid questions that don't make sense or can't be answered on the data.
The complete set of questions is as follows:

# Next Steps
<!-- TODO: Add intro about how these are general ideas (not in order) -->

### Prompt Engineering
<!-- TODO: Prompt engineering is the first major next step to take for improvement -->

### Fine Tuning
<!-- TODO: Add section about why fine tuning is important -->
<!-- TODO: cost considerations (probaly only a few dollars for GPT 3.5) -->
<!-- TODO: Fine tuning generally helps the language model produce a more correct answer the first time -->

### Additional Tools/Steps
<!-- TODO: Talk about additional steps that could be added to the agent to make it better -->

#### Reducing Ambiguity
<!-- TODO: Ambiguity identification steps -->
<!-- TODO: Use a language model to first identify ambiguous questions (possibly in relation to DB schema) -->
<!-- TODO: If identified as ambiguous, use a model to rewrite the question to be less ambiguous/take a side -->
<!-- TODO: Give the user a warning if their question is ambiguous alongside the rewritten question to show the user how the model is interpreting their question. -->

#### Post Processing
<!-- TODO: After the answer is generated, is there a way we can try to check if it answers the question? Is something like that even needed, or are the models alone good enough at answering the question, even if data is wrong -->
